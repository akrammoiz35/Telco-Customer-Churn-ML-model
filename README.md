# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using various machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Model comparison: **KNN**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Tree**  
- Handling imbalanced data using **ROC** and **AUC** evaluation  

## Technologies Used

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Results

The model with the best performance was selected based on **ROC and AUC curves** due to imbalanced data.
