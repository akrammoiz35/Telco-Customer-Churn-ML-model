# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using various machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Model comparison: **KNN**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Tree**  
- Handling imbalanced data using **ROC** and **AUC** evaluation  

## Technologies Used

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, Matplotlib

## Results

The model with the best performance was selected based on **ROC and AUC curves** due to imbalanced data.

## Visualizations

I used **Seaborn** and **Plotly** libraries to create interactive and insightful visualizations that helped uncover trends and patterns in the data.
